This is a Django project to be deployed on Google App Engine, and using the High
Replication Datastore. The deployment can be found at
http://gb-testblog.appspot.com/.

The integration of Django with App Engine is done by ignoring the regular Django
models and dealing directly with the Datastore using the Google API. Because of
this, some of the conveniences of Django could not be used, most notably the
admin interface and generic views. Instead most of the functionality is written
directly into the views. Authentication is handled with the App Engine Users
API.

The basic workings of the blog are as follows:
- The blog contains posts and comments, each of which has a title and a body
- Any logged in user can create a post
- Only that user, or an administrator, can edit or delete that post
- Anyone can comment on a post, even anonymous users
- An administrator can delete any comment
- A logged in user can delete their own comments
- An anonymous user cannot delete any comments

A small bit of unobtrusive AJAX is used for adding and deleting comments (with
JQuery).
